Dynamic Copyright provides a simple block for the WordPress block or site editing experience, which will dynamically display the copyright mark and the year before your copyright declaration.

The dynamic copyright block gives you the flexability to display your copyright without having to update it when the year changes.

## Features:

1. Text color settings
2. Link color settings
3. Padding controls
4. Margin controls
5. Width settings

I have created this plugin to use in my own projects and is part of my current WordPress installs.
